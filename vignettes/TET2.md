# Introduction

Long before any of you were born, back in 2010, an exciting paper came out 
which purported to show that _IDH1_, _IDH2_, and _TET2_ mutations shared a 
phenotype of hypermethylation owing to loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The 
details can be found in [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015), 
which is indeed a landmark. Nevertheless, some fine details of the work seemed
to disagree with the results of other cohorts when replication was attempted.

Some of you who have seen volcano plots before can guess where this is going.

# The data


```r

library(limma)


library(GEOquery)

#DName not found, showed up as warning message
if (!exists("DNAme")) data(DNAme)


if (FALSE) { # this takes about 5 minutes:

  # needed to fetch data
  library(GEOquery) 
  install
  MSK_HOVON <- getGEO("GSE24505")

  # skip the expression data:
  platform <- sapply(MSK_HOVON, annotation)
  methylation <- which(platform == "GPL6604")
  DNAme <- MSK_HOVON[[methylation]] # GPL6604, HG17_HELP_PROMOTER 
  DNAme$male <-ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1=="sex (male.1_female.2): 1",1,0)
  DNAme$TET2 <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.7 == "tet2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$IDH <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.8 == "idh1.idh2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$purity <- as.integer(DNAme$"bm_%blasts:ch1") / 100
  save(DNAme, file="../data/DNAme.rda")

}

# how many probes, how many patients?
dim(DNAme)
#> Features  Samples 
#>    25626      394
# Features  Samples
#    25626      394
```

### Some contrasts

Is it the case that TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations are exclusive?

![](TET2_files/figure-html/heatmap-1.png)<!-- -->

```r

# get any samples that have both genes mutated
(non_exclusive  <- medata %>% dplyr::filter(TET2 == 1 & IDH == 1))
#>           TET2 IDH
#> GSM604380    1   1
medata %>% table()
#>     IDH
#> TET2   0   1
#>    0 302  50
#>    1  41   1
```
‚ùó _GSM604380 is not exclusive for the mutation._ One of the results from the
paper is that the mutations are mutually exclusive. The data from this code
does not match what is found in their results.

Do we see genome-wide hypermethylation from TET2 mutations?

# pull top ranked significant genes from liner model fit, get probes for each
