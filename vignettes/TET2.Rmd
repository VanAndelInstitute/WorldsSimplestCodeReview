# Installation

Install the WorldsSimplestCodeReview package, if you haven't. 

```{r, loadpkgs, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
#install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("VanAndelInstitute/WorldsSimplestCodeReview")
library(knitr)
```

To extract just the R code, you can use knitr::knit(input, tangle=TRUE):

```{r, tangle, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# knitr::knit("TET2.Rmd", tangle = TRUE) 
# [1] "TET2.R"
```

# Introduction

Long before any of you were born, back in 2010, an exciting paper came out 
which purported to show that _IDH1_, _IDH2_, and _TET2_ mutations shared a 
phenotype of hypermethylation owing to loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The 
details can be found in [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015), 
which is indeed a landmark. Nevertheless, some fine details of the work seemed
to disagree with the results of other cohorts when replication was attempted.

#To be accurate, all of the 2021 cohort members were very much so alive prior 
#to 2010

Some of you who have seen volcano plots before can guess where this is going.

# The data

```{r, fetchGEO}

library(limma)
library(GEOquery)
if (!exists("DNAme")) data(DNAme)

if (FALSE) { # this takes about 5 minutes:

  # needed to fetch data
  library(GEOquery) 
  MSK_HOVON <- getGEO("GSE24505")

  # skip the expression data:
  platform <- sapply(MSK_HOVON, annotation)
  methylation <- which(platform == "GPL6604")
  DNAme <- MSK_HOVON[[methylation]] # GPL6604, HG17_HELP_PROMOTER 
  DNAme$male <-ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1=="sex (male.1_female.2): 1",1,0)
  DNAme$TET2 <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.7 == "tet2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$IDH <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.8 == "idh1.idh2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$purity <- as.integer(DNAme$"bm_%blasts:ch1") / 100
  save(DNAme, file="../data/DNAme.rda")

}

# how many probes, how many patients?
dim(DNAme)
# Features    Samples
#    25626     394
```
#^^note:features==probes, samples==patients
#^^this output indicates that only 25,626 CpG sites are available for analysis,
#though the original paper reports testing ~50,000 sites. Why is there such a
#discrepancy?
#original paper excludes 15 of 398 patients for analysis, yet there are still 
#394 patients included in the dataframe. Why are there not 385 patients 
#included, as reported in the paper?

### Some contrasts

Is it the case that TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations are exclusive?

```{r, heatmap, eval=TRUE}

# always plot your data
library(ComplexHeatmap)
mutations <- t(as.matrix(pData(DNAme)[, c("TET2", "IDH")]))
Heatmap(mutations, col=c("lightgray","darkred"), name="mutant", column_km=4,
        column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 7))

```

Do we see genome-wide hypermethylation from TET2 mutations? 

```{r, TET2_vs_IDH}

# model TET2 and IDH1/2 mutant related hypermethylation
# note: there are plenty of confounders (pb%, bm%, wbc) that could be included
library(limma) 

# simplest design

#Paige's code review:
 ##The following additions were necessary in the first chunk of code:
 #1) BiocManager::install("GEOquery")
 #2) BiocManager::install("limma")
 
#Paige's science review:
 1) Assumptions regarding the term "probe":
         A) I assume a "probe" is one of the ~50,000 CpG islands sites 
         that the authors looked at in the paper.
         B) I also assume that "6513 probes for IDH" (for example) infers that 
         the same 6513 CpG islands are mutated across all samples harboring an 
         IDH mutation.
 2) According to the heatmap provided (under #always plot your data), 
 it is evident IF either IDH1/2 or TET2 mutations are present in the AML
 patients, these mutations LARGELY occur mutually exclusive of each other.
 However, it should be noted that most of the samples harbored neither mutation.
 Additionally,the heatmap also demonstrates a small population of samples that 
 harbor both mutations.Therefore, it is misleading to say these mutations are 
 mutually exclusive.
       A) Question: If the vast majority of the samples extracted from these AML
       patients do not harbor either mutation, is this really a defining 
       feature of AML?
 3) The 6500+ hits for methylated CpG sites in IDH mutated-samples vs. 
 the ~10 hits for the TET2 mutated-samples indicates that these mutations have 
 differential associations with hypermethylation at CpG sites. It is misleading
 for the authors to indicate that both kinds of mutations engender "overlapping"
 hypermethylation signatures, considering that even if all TET2-related sites
 overlapped with the IDH-related sites, this only represents 0.15% of all
 sites implicated by IDH mutation.
