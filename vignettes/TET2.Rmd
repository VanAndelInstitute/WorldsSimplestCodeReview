# Introduction

Long before any of you were born, back in 2010, an exciting paper came
out which purported to show that *IDH1*, *IDH2*, and *TET2* mutations
shared a phenotype of hypermethylation owing to loss of
5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The details can be found in [the
paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015), which is indeed a
landmark. Nevertheless, some fine details of the work seemed to disagree
with the results of other cohorts when replication was attempted.

![The money shot](figure/TET2.png)

Some of you who have seen volcano plots before can guess where this is
going.

# The data

```{r, fetchGEO}

library(limma)   
library(GEOquery) 
if (!exists("DNAme")) data(DNAme)  

if (FALSE) { # this takes about 5 minutes:   #if there is not a value for DNAme data, we will need to go retrieve it from the paper)

  # needed to fetch data
  library(GEOquery) 
  MSK_HOVON <- getGEO("GSE24505")

  # skip the expression data:
  platform <- sapply(MSK_HOVON, annotation)
  methylation <- which(platform == "GPL6604")
  DNAme <- MSK_HOVON[[methylation]] # GPL6604, HG17_HELP_PROMOTER    #this takes just the methylation data
  DNAme$male <-ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1=="sex (male.1_female.2):   #sex data 1",1,0)
  DNAme$TET2 <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.7 == "tet2: WT", 0, 1) #tet mutation info
  DNAme$IDH <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.8 == "idh1.idh2: WT", 0, 1) #idh mutation info
  DNAme$purity <- as.integer(DNAme$"bm_%blasts:ch1") / 100  #purity of the sample info
  save(DNAme, file="../data/DNAme.rda")  #save to a loval file

}

# how many probes, how many patients?
dim(DNAme)
# Probes       #Patients
#25626        #394

#head(DNAme)

```

### Some contrasts

Is it the case that TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations are exclusive?

1) Group 4 is not mutually exclusive and is associated with both TET2 *and* IDH mutations.

2)Otherwise, they are EITHER mututally exlusive OR not present at all.

```{r, heatmap, eval=TRUE}

# always plot your data
library(ComplexHeatmap) #this is the heatmap we will use
mutations <- t(as.matrix(pData(DNAme)[, c("TET2", "IDH")]))   #group data by mutations using only TET2 column and IDH column
Heatmap(mutations, col=c("lightgray","darkred"), name="mutant",column_km=4,
        column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 0)) #make the heatmap, 4 clusters, removed x labels - can't see them anyways

```




Do we see genome-wide hypermethylation from TET2 mutations?

```{r, TET2_vs_IDH}

# model TET2 and IDH1/2 mutant related hypermethylation
# note: there are plenty of confounders (pb%, bm%, wbc) that could be included
library(limma) #limma is a library to deal with microarray data

# simplest design

## Richard code critiques

1) Had to install a few packages, but this was doable with James' help.

2) Removed some excess labeling from the generated heatmap since it couldn't be read anyways.

3) Annotated the code that I could. 

## Richard science critiques

1) One group from the clustered heatmap has mutations in both IDH and TET2 indicating that they are not entirely mutually exclusive as claimed in the paper. 

2) Number of TET probes is considerably lower than IDH probes. This does not indicate similar methylation patterns for both mutants. They seem drastically different since there are 6-10 methylation positive probes for TET but >1000 positives for IDH.
