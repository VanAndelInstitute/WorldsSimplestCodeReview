# Installation

Install the WorldsSimplestCodeReview package, if you haven't. 

```{r message=FALSE, loadpkgs, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
install.packages("BiocManager")
library(BiocManager)
if (!require("GEOquery")) {
  BiocManager::install("GEOquery")
  library(GEOquery)
}
if(!require("limma")) {
  BiocManager::install("limma")
  library(limma)
} 
#Kate told me I needed this and then I started Rstudio again and now it
#seems to work. 
BiocManager::install("VanAndelInstitute/WorldsSimplestCodeReview")
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

library(devtools)
load_all("./")
```

To extract just the R code, you can use knitr::knit(input, tangle=TRUE):

```{r, tangle, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
knitr::knit("TET2.Rmd", tangle = TRUE) 
"TET2.R"
#when I run this chunk nothing appears to happen.
```

# Introduction

Long before any of you were born, back in 2010, an exciting paper came out 
which purported to show that _IDH1_, _IDH2_, and _TET2_ mutations shared a 
phenotype of hypermethylation owing to loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The 
details can be found in [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015), 
which is indeed a landmark. Nevertheless, some fine details of the work seemed
to disagree with the results of other cohorts when replication was attempted.

Some of you who have seen volcano plots before can guess where this is going.

# The data

```{r, fetchGEO}

library(limma)
library(GEOquery)
if (!exists("DNAme")) data(DNAme)

if (FALSE) { # this takes about 5 minutes:

  # needed to fetch data
  library(GEOquery) 
  MSK_HOVON <- getGEO("GSE24505")

  # skip the expression data:
  platform <- sapply(MSK_HOVON, annotation)
  methylation <- which(platform == "GPL6604")
  DNAme <- MSK_HOVON[[methylation]] # GPL6604, HG17_HELP_PROMOTER 
  DNAme$male <-ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1=="sex (male.1_female.2): 1",1,0)
  DNAme$TET2 <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.7 == "tet2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$IDH <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.8 == "idh1.idh2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$purity <- as.integer(DNAme$"bm_%blasts:ch1") / 100
  save(DNAme, file="../data/DNAme.rda")

}

# how many probes, how many patients?
dim(DNAme)
#I get the same answer as what the vignette has
#It made something. A large data set of a format that I don't understand
view(DNAme)

```

### Some contrasts

Is it the case that TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations are exclusive?
_With the exception of GSM604380/patient 316, TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations are exclusive._

```{r, heatmap, eval=TRUE}

# always plot your data
install.packages("nat")
install.packages("ComplexHeatmap")
library(ComplexHeatmap)
mutations <- t(as.matrix(pData(DNAme)[, c("TET2", "IDH")]))
Heatmap(mutations, col=c("lightgray","darkred"), name="mutant", column_km=4,
        column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 7))

```

### Healthy curiosity
```{r, The OddBall}
library(tidyverse)
# one patient is the odd-ball here
as_tibble(DNAme$`idh1.idh2:ch1`) -> idh1_idh2
# since there is ch1 and 2, I compared both and they have the exact same information
# as_tibble(DNAme$`idh1.idh2:ch2`) -> idh1_idh2_next
# idh1_idh2 == idh1_idh2_next - returns TRUE
as_tibble(DNAme$`tet2:ch1`) -> tet
# as_tibble(DNAme$`tet2:ch2`) -> tet_2
# tet == tet_2 - returns TRUE
colnames(tet) <- c("TET")
colnames(idh1_idh2) <- c("IDH")
compiled <- cbind(tet, idh1_idh2)
View(compiled) # scrolled through and identified the patient/sample number that had the mutations in both TET2 and IDH
```

Do we see genome-wide hypermethylation from TET2 mutations? 

```{r, TET2_vs_IDH}

# model TET2 and IDH1/2 mutant related hypermethylation
# note: there are plenty of confounders (pb%, bm%, wbc) that could be included
library(limma) 

# simplest design
design1 <- with(pData(DNAme), model.matrix( ~ IDH + TET2 ))
fit1 <- eBayes(lmFit(exprs(DNAme), design1))
(IDH_diffmeth_probes_fit1 <- nrow(topTable(fit1, 
                                           coef=grep("IDH", colnames(design1)), 
                                           p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                           number=Inf)))
# 6513 probes for IDH

(TET_diffmeth_probes_fit1 <- nrow(topTable(fit1,

                                           p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                           number=Inf)))
# 6 probes for TET2

# control for sex
design2 <- with(pData(DNAme), model.matrix( ~ IDH + TET2 + male ))
fit2 <- eBayes(lmFit(exprs(DNAme), design2))
(IDH_diffmeth_probes_fit2 <- nrow(topTable(fit2, 
                                           coef=grep("IDH", colnames(design2)), 
                                           p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                           number=Inf)))
# 6651 probes for IDH 

(TET2_diffmeth_probes_fit2 <- nrow(topTable(fit2, 
                                            coef=grep("TET", colnames(design2)),
                                            p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                            number=Inf)))
# 7 probes for TET2

# control for blast count
design3 <- with(pData(DNAme), model.matrix( ~ IDH:purity + TET2:purity))
fit3 <- eBayes(lmFit(exprs(DNAme)[, as.integer(rownames(design3))], design3))

(IDH_diffmeth_probes_fit3 <- nrow(topTable(fit3, 
                                           coef=grep("IDH", colnames(design3)), 
                                           p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                           number=Inf)))
# 7450 probes for IDH:purity

(TET2_diffmeth_probes_fit3 <- nrow(topTable(fit3, 
                                            coef=grep("TET", colnames(design3)),
                                            p.value=0.05, # change if you like 
                                            number=Inf)))
# 10 probes for TET2:purity

```

I'm unsure of how to interpret the code above:
- The annotation/description of the designs are unclear. 
- Why would we run the code this way?
- What do the probe numbers mean?
- How can this be translated into assessing genome-wide methylation?
