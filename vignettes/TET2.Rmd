```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
library(devtools)
load_all("./") 
# the load_all("./") is necessary to make the code run (DNAme does not work without it)
```

# Installation

Install the WorldsSimplestCodeReview package, if you haven't. 

```{r, loadpkgs, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
#install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("VanAndelInstitute/WorldsSimplestCodeReview")
library(knitr)
```

To extract just the R code, you can use knitr::knit(input, tangle=TRUE):

```{r, tangle, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# knitr::knit("TET2.Rmd", tangle = TRUE) 
# [1] "TET2.R"
```

# Introduction

Long before any of you were born, back in 2010, an exciting paper came out 
which purported to show that _IDH1_, _IDH2_, and _TET2_ mutations shared a 
phenotype of hypermethylation owing to loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The 
details can be found in [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015), 
which is indeed a landmark. Nevertheless, some fine details of the work seemed
to disagree with the results of other cohorts when replication was attempted.

Some of you who have seen volcano plots before can guess where this is going.

# The data

```{r, fetchGEO}

library(limma)
library(GEOquery)
if (!exists("DNAme")) data(DNAme)

if (FALSE) { # this takes about 5 minutes:

  # needed to fetch data
  library(GEOquery) 
  MSK_HOVON <- getGEO("GSE24505")

  # skip the expression data:
  platform <- sapply(MSK_HOVON, annotation)
  methylation <- which(platform == "GPL6604")
  DNAme <- MSK_HOVON[[methylation]] # GPL6604, HG17_HELP_PROMOTER 
  DNAme$male <-ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1=="sex (male.1_female.2): 1",1,0)
  DNAme$TET2 <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.7 == "tet2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$IDH <- ifelse(DNAme$characteristics_ch1.8 == "idh1.idh2: WT", 0, 1)
  DNAme$purity <- as.integer(DNAme$"bm_%blasts:ch1") / 100
  save(DNAme, file="../data/DNAme.rda")

}

# how many probes, how many patients?
dim(DNAme)
# Features  Samples
#    25626      394

```

### Some contrasts

Is it the case that TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations are exclusive?

```{r, heatmap, eval=TRUE}

# always plot your data
library(ComplexHeatmap)
mutations <- t(as.matrix(pData(DNAme)[, c("TET2", "IDH")]))
Heatmap(mutations, col=c("lightgray","darkred"), name="mutant", column_km=4,
        column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 7))

```

Do we see genome-wide hypermethylation from TET2 mutations? 

```{r, TET2_vs_IDH}

# model TET2 and IDH1/2 mutant related hypermethylation
# note: there are plenty of confounders (pb%, bm%, wbc) that could be included
library(limma) 

# simplest design
design1 <- with(pData(DNAme), model.matrix( ~ IDH + TET2 ))
fit1 <- eBayes(lmFit(exprs(DNAme), design1))

                                           coef=grep("IDH", colnames(design1)),
